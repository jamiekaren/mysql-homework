## Development and Technical Details

_Programming Languages_
- Node.js
- mySQL

This app implements the use of mySQL, creating a database of products with various quantities, and uses Node.js to allow the user to interact with this database, including impementing CRUD fuctions.

### This App Development
It was fun to use my new skills with mySQL to create this simple mock shopping application. I was also able to use some fun NPM packages like inquirer (which is probably of my favorites). It was a challenge to work out how to write the logic for checking the requested inventory from the user and comparing it to the current inventory in the database, but I enjoyed figuring it out.
